Web automation

This was a prototype (MVP) of web automation with the Nando's UK website. This was done using Python and Selenium to accomplish the following:

🖱. Click through the website and order a single dish

🔐. Log in to a user account

📧. Grab a 2-factor code from an email inbox, using a regex filter on the most recent unread message subject line

📋. Paste that code in the sign-in page

📸. Get to the final payment page and take a screenshot of available payment methods
