Web automation

This was a prototype (MVP) of web automation using the Nando's UK website and reach the payment / checkout page.

This was created using Python and Selenium to accomplish the following:

🖱. Click through the website, finding and ordering a single dish

🔐. Log in to a user account created previously (as the automation window does not have any local data, new login has to be done every session)

📧. Grab a 2-factor code from an email inbox (Gmail), translate into text and use a filter to find the code from the message subject line

📋. Paste that code in the sign-in page

📸. Get to the final payment page and take a screenshot of available payment methods

In action:
